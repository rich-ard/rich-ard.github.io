### The Why

The last couple of years have been amazing, and perhaps in their excitment I have become complacent: rather than continuing to plan ahead, to map out what's next, I'm sort of being carried along by momentum.

Time to reel that in a bit and use my github account to display the neat stuff I'm learning every day, to any audience that cares to check it out, but mostly to myself: in a month; in a year.

### The How

I built this site with the Ruby gem [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and tied it to the free storage I get from [GitHub](https://github.com). The layout was done with [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

### The When

I really ought to update this at least weekly with something moderately interesting. I have a few visualization projects in mind, so we'll see how those come along. I also start classes for my statistics MS in about a week, so we'll see how scheduling works.

### The Who

Married to an active activist, five kids deep, happy on a bike or under a bar, terrible with money, okay with a wrench. I'm [just this guy, you know?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmvHY-h8bSo)
