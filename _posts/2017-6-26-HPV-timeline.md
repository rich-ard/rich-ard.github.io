title: Visualizing the CDC's HPV Vaccination Recommendations

### What is it?

As this ended up being discarded for use in a project, I feel comfortable sharing it here: this is a timeline, built in Excel, intended to serve as a model for an algorithm to interpret retrospective data.

### The Visualization:

### What I would do differently:

I think that the above gets the job done: it can be readily interpreted as a timeline map, and separates sub-populations reasonably well. But there's no real 'flow' from one time point to the next, and I would like to revisit this to make it more visually fluid.
