## What's going on here?

In between catching up on John Scalzi novels and trying to get my kids to bed, I'm making a place where I can remember the little things I might need next time someone asks for an ad-hoc report or an alternative to a box plot.

## Who's responsible for this?

I'm Richard Brandt, a 

* data technician in the Dep't of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at [WMed](https://med.wmich.edu)
* graduate student in the [Statistics department](https://wmich.edu/statistics) at Western Michigan University
* terrible bicycle racer
* married man with just shy of half a dozen children
* former graphic design student and once-intended-draughtsman who is overcome with glee at the idea that I can draw pictures and also get ideas across to people even though I'm colorblind

## What is this site built on?

*iworkoverti.me* is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and laid out with [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com), which is in turn a part of the [Poole](https://getpoole.com) method of building Jekyll themes. It allows me to write this site in Markdown, which is awesome because I can code webpages (a) directly in RStudio or Spyder, and (b) don't have to muck around with HTML hardly at all. This makes for small pages, fast load times, and less headache on my end.

I will probably add Disqus commenting at some point as well, but don't hold me to it.
